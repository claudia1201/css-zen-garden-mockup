## CSS Zen Garden

### Description

The [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a famous site in the history of front-end development.

The concept behind the CSS Zen Garden is that there's only a single page's worth of HTML on the site -- that HTML has content which explains the task and requirements to anyone interested in submitting a design. The only variable is the stylesheet attached to the page. Examples on the Zen Garden radically alter the presentation and experience of the site without touching the HTML itself.

The site itself served the purpose of illustrating the true power of CSS to web developers in the bad old days of tabular layouts and specifying display properties inside outmoded HTML elements; it's fair to say that it's done as much for modern front-end conceptions of quality as any other resource.

As a tribute to the Zen Garden, I made my own CSS-only exercise. **I re-created the mock images provided, but only used CSS.** The HTML was created for me - `current.html` and `future.html`. You'll notice that the HTML is the same in both files, except for that it references a different stylesheet.
